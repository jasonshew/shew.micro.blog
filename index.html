<p>What comes to mind when you see the full moon?</p>
<p>For me, it’s always this passage from <em>The Sheltering Sky</em>:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>Because we don&rsquo;t know when we will die<br>
We get to think of life as an inexhaustible well<br>
Yet everything happens only a certain number of times<br>
And a very small number, really<br>
How many more times will you remember a certain afternoon of your childhood<br>
Some afternoon that is so deeply a part of your being that you can&rsquo;t even conceive your life without it?<br>
Perhaps four or five times more<br>
Perhaps not even that<br>
How many more times will you watch the full moon rise?<br>
Perhaps twenty, and yet it all seems limitless<br>
— Paul Bowles</p>
</blockquote>

<p>As my iPhone was being serviced at the Genius Bar, I got to spend some quality time with my iPod classic again. There’s a thrill in spinning 2025 tracks on a gadget from 2007. At this point, it’s actually old enough to vote.</p>

		<div class="e-content">
			 <p>When a person cannot satisfy their deeper emotional needs, like love, security, belonging, or purpose, they often redirect that emptiness into various substitute desires / compensatory behaviours that afford immediate pleasures or comforts. These substitutes can become excessive, inappropriate, or addictive, thus often referred to as &ldquo;bad habits.&rdquo; Examples include:</p>
<ul>
<li>Sexual desire (overly seeking sex)</li>
<li>Material desire (shopping, hoarding, etc.)</li>
<li>Food-related desires (overeating, binge eating, eating disorders, etc.)</li>
<li>Substance use (smoking, drinking alcohol)</li>
<li>Behavioural addictions (such as video games)</li>
</ul>
<p>These compensations can feel soothing in the short term, but they don’t address the root cause. Over time, they can spiral into addictions or unhealthy patterns, which only widen the gap between what a person truly needs and what they’re chasing.</p>
<p>It’s clearly a vicious cycle: unmet needs → temporary coping behaviours → guilt/shame or further emptiness → even stronger cravings. Breaking this cycle usually requires not just self-control, but also self-awareness and sometimes therapy to identify the underlying emotional void.</p>
<p>Addictions and compulsive behaviours aren’t just &ldquo;bad habits.&rdquo; They’re often signals that something deeper in us is being ignored. If we learn to listen to those signals instead of numbing them, we can actually grow in healthier ways.</p>

			 <p>Among the three stars — Vega, Altair, and the Sun — Vega will die first, followed by Altair, and then our Sun, which will be the last to reach the end of its life.</p>
<p>The primary reason for this sequence lies in their masses and lifespans, which are inversely related: the more massive a star, the faster it burns through its nuclear fuel and the shorter its lifespan.</p>
<h3 id="stellar-mass-and-lifespan-the-trade-off">Stellar Mass and Lifespan: The Trade-Off</h3>
<p>To understand this better, let’s compare their masses and expected main-sequence lifespans:</p>
<table>
<thead>
<tr>
<th style="text-align:center">Star</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Spectral Type</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Mass (Sun = 1)</th>
<th style="text-align:center">Estimated Lifespan (Main Sequence)</th>
</tr>
</thead>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Vega</td>
<td style="text-align:center">A0V</td>
<td style="text-align:center">~2.1</td>
<td style="text-align:center">~500 million years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Altair</td>
<td style="text-align:center">A7V</td>
<td style="text-align:center">~1.8</td>
<td style="text-align:center">~1–2 billion years</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td style="text-align:center">Sun</td>
<td style="text-align:center">G2V</td>
<td style="text-align:center">1.0</td>
<td style="text-align:center">~10 billion years</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>
<ul>
<li>Vega, the brightest star in the constellation Lyra, is more than twice as massive as the Sun. It is a relatively young star, around 450 million years old, and is already about halfway through its main-sequence life. At this pace, it’s expected to exhaust its core hydrogen in less than 500 million years from now.</li>
<li>Altair, the brightest star in Aquila, is slightly less massive than Vega and rotates very rapidly. Its mass gives it a longer lifespan than Vega—about 1 to 2 billion years in total.</li>
<li>The Sun, our middle-aged yellow dwarf, has an estimated total lifespan of about 10 billion years. Currently, it is about 4.6 billion years old, with roughly 5 billion years remaining before it leaves the main sequence.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="why-bigger-stars-die-sooner">Why Bigger Stars Die Sooner</h3>
<p>Massive stars have stronger gravitational pressure at their cores, which leads to higher temperatures and faster nuclear fusion. Although they have more fuel to burn, they burn it much more rapidly, dramatically shortening their lifespans.</p>
<p>In contrast, stars like the Sun burn fuel more slowly and steadily, giving them far longer to shine.</p>
<h3 id="conclusion">Conclusion</h3>
<p>Vega will die first, likely within a few hundred million years. Altair will follow, and the Sun will live the longest of the three. Their fates serve as a reminder of the delicate balance between mass, energy, and time in stellar evolution.</p>

			 <p>Back in <strong>1980</strong>, KFC had around <strong>6,000</strong> locations across <strong>48</strong> countries, pulling in <strong>$2 billion</strong> a year ($2 billion in 1980 is roughly $7.66 billion in today’s dollars).</p>
<p>Fast forward to <strong>2023</strong>, and the brand had grown to nearly <strong>30,000</strong> outlets in <strong>145</strong> countries, with annual sales reaching <strong>$2.83 billion</strong>.</p>

			 <p>JavaScript short date-time format:</p>
<ul>
<li>United States: Tue, 02/18/2025, 1:58 AM EST</li>
<li>Canada: Tue, 2025-02-18, 1:58 a.m. EST</li>
</ul>
<p>Without a doubt, the Canadian short date looks cleaner and more visually appealing, and the “a.m.” (or “p.m.”) style has a classic touch. However, it’s four characters long. Also, in the long date-time format, the word “at” appears between the date and time, whereas in the short version, it’s simply replaced by a comma. I dislike seeing more than one comma in a timestamp, so on this site, what you actually see is a hybrid version: <strong>Tue, 2025-02-18 @ 1:58 AM EST</strong>.</p>

			 <p>Places like Value Village always leave me with mixed emotions. As soon as I walk in, I feel a rush of excitement. There’s an eclectic assortment of items, many of them surprisingly decent and offered at affordable prices. But in the end, I always feel a bit sentimental. These items were likely cherished by their original owners at one time, only to end up being sold for next to nothing. It’s bittersweet — and in a way, it feels like a reflection of human relationships.</p>

			 <p>During the chaos of my parents’ divorce (when I was around 11), my uncles on my mother’s side (or maybe my grandmother—I can’t quite remember, but it doesn’t really matter since they shared the same values) offered to take me to a theme park out of town. But shortly after, they had a change of heart. They wanted to see who I would end up living with. Basically, if I had chosen to stay with my dad, whom they saw as their sworn enemy, they wouldn’t have bothered with me or the trip. I have to admit, for most of my adult life, I didn’t think anything was wrong with that—it’s kind of like how economics works: your employer is likely to withdraw benefits when they know you’re intent on leaving for another employer, seeing it as a way to avoid needless losses.</p>
<p>However, when I casually mentioned this to my landlord (yes, I’ve had many heart-to-hearts with this older lady), she was surprised, even a bit confused. She was like, “I don’t know what they were thinking, but if you were my grandchild and I knew you were leaving us to live with your dad, I’d want to take you anywhere you wanted and give you the best I could—because I wouldn’t know when I’d see you again.”</p>
<p>My eyes welled up. I was genuinely shocked to hear such a different perspective. Some people strictly prioritize benefits over kindness, while others don’t really care about gains and losses. It really got me thinking a lot about family values and what unconditional love truly meant. At one point, I even felt like I didn’t really know what love was.</p>
<p>I couldn’t choose the family I was born into, but I can choose to carry that conversation with me forever.</p>

			 <p>I wonder if there is a way for these music streaming platforms to prevent what I call &ldquo;<strong>namespace pollution</strong>.&rdquo; This term refers to different artists sharing the same name and being grouped together on a single artist page, especially when they are mononymous or have very common names. It’s really frustrating because, despite having the same name, these artists often create music in completely different genres and languages!</p>
